The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For spring 2024, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Speaker:** Luke Geeson

**Title:** Compiler Testing with Relaxed Memory Models

**Abstract:** Finding bugs is key to the correctness of compilers in wide use today. If the behaviour of a compiled program, as allowed by its architecture memory model, is not a behaviour of the source program under its source model, then there is a bug. This holds for all programs, but we focus on concurrency bugs that occur only with two or more threads of execution. We focus on testing techniques that detect such bugs in C/C++ compilers.
 
We seek a testing technique that automatically covers concurrency bugs up to fixed bounds on program sizes and that scales to find bugs in compiled programs with many lines of code. Otherwise, a testing technique can miss bugs. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art techniques are yet to satisfy all of these properties.
 
We present the Téléchat compiler testing tool for concurrent programs. Téléchat compiles a concurrent C/C++ program and compares source and compiled program behaviours using source and architecture memory models. We make three claims: Téléchat improves the state-of-the-art at finding bugs in code generation for multi-threaded execution, it is the first public description of a compiler testing tool for concurrency that is deployed in industry, and it is the first tool that takes a significant step towards the desired properties. We provide experimental evidence suggesting Téléchat finds bugs missed by other state-of-the-art techniques, case studies indicating that Téléchat satisfies the properties, and reports of our experience deploying Téléchat in industry regression testing.

**Bio:** Luke is a Computer Science PhD student at UCL, supervised by James Brotherston, Earl Barr, and Lee Smith. He is developing techniques to find concurrency bugs in C/C++ compilers using formal models of relaxed memory concurrency. 

He is based in the compiler teams at Arm in Cambridge where he assists engineers with finding bugs and deploying automated concurrency testing as part of an EPSRC grant. Luke's opinions are his own and Arm does not endorse his work.

**Title:** Ozone: Fully Out-of-Order Choreographies

**Abstract:** Choreographic programming is a paradigm for writing distributed applications. It allows programmers to write a single program, called a choreography, that can be compiled to generate correct implementations of each process in the application. Although choreographies provide good static guarantees, they can exhibit high latency when messages or processes are delayed. This is because processes in a choreography typically execute in a fixed, deterministic order, and cannot adapt to the order that messages arrive at runtime. In non-choreographic code, programmers can address this problem by allowing processes to execute out of order -- for instance by using futures or reactive programming. However, in choreographic code, out-of-order process execution can lead to serious and subtle bugs, called communication integrity violations (CIVs).

In this paper, we develop a model of choreographic programming for out-of-order processes that guarantees absence of CIVs and deadlocks. As an application of our approach, we also introduce an API for safe non-blocking communication via futures in the choreographic programming language Choral. The API allows processes to execute out of order, participate in multiple choreographies concurrently, and to handle unordered or dropped messages as in the UDP transport protocol. We provide an illustrative evaluation of our API, showing that out-of-order execution can reduce latency by overlapping communication with computation.

**Bio:** Dan works as a postdoc at the University of Southern Denmark and is receiving his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He is the author of the UIGC library for Akka, which provides fault-tolerant resource management for distributed actor systems. Dan’s research focuses on making distributed reactive applications easier to write and reason about.
