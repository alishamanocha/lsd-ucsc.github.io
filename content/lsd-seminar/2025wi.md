**Time**: Fridays, noon - 1:05pm (PT) <br />
**Location**: The Internet / The LSD Lab (Engineering 2, Room 398) <br />
**Organizers**: Lindsey Kuper, Tyler Sorensen, Reese Levine, and Gan Shen <br />

The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For winter 2025, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.


Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Speaker:** Mako Bates

**Title:** Choreographic Programming in theory and practice

**Abstract:** Writing systems of concurrently executing programs is difficult: they can behave (and fail) in unexpected ways because of race conditions and deadlocks. When we talk about what we want these systems to do, we often tell “Alice & Bob” stories to describe the intended protocol. The fundamental idea of choreographic programming is that we can write real software that same way: as a single thread of activity described from a “3rd-party omniscient” perspective. Research on choreographic programming evolved out of formal protocol-specification methods over a decade ago, but systems that can actually be used to write software (e.g. Choral, HasChor, and MultiChor) are only a couple years old. My team and I have developed several such implementations with novel type-directed correctness guarantees. In this talk I will present a summary of our own work as well as a review of other relevant cutting-edge systems.

**Bio:** Mako Bates is a PhD candidate at the University of Vermont, advised by Joseph Near. He has done research and development of choreographic programming systems, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy. Prior to starting his PhD, he worked in industry for several years.

**Speaker:** Tim Goodwin

**Title:** What if Kubernetes was a compiler target?

**Abstract:** Multi-tier programming, a concept from the programming languages community, provides abstractions for building multiple components of a distributed application as parts of a single program. Modern software development, however, often moves in the opposite direction: applications are typically composed of independently developed programs that are later integrated through service APIs. While distributing an application into independent units has its benefits, this approach requires developers to write repetitive plumbing code to connect application components and forces them to navigate an error-prone configuration and deployment process to ultimately get things working. Multi-tier programming offers a solution to these challenges, yet it remains relatively unknown in industry. However, closely related topics—such as “monolith vs. microservice,” “monorepo or separate repos,” and even “common language or polyglot”—receive lots of attention and discussion in the software engineering community. In this talk, I will provide an overview of multi-tier programming and how it might simplify software development on Kubernetes, a popular platform for running containerized applications. I will also demonstrate a prototype “Kubernetes compiler” that can turn a monolithic codebase into a distributed application that runs on Kubernetes.

**Bio:** Tim Goodwin is a 3rd year PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, advised by Lindsey Kuper and Andrew Quinn. His research focuses on cloud-native programming models and the challenges they present to developers. Prior to grad school, he wrangled with microservice complexity in industry.
