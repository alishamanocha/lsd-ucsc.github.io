**Time**: Fridays, noon - 1:05pm (PT) <br />
**Location**: The Internet / The LSD Lab (Engineering 2, Room 398) <br />
**Organizers**: Lindsey Kuper, Tyler Sorensen, Reese Levine, and Gan Shen <br />

The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For spring 2025, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.


Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

## April 4

**Speaker:** Shadaj Laddad 

**Title:** Hydro: Modular, Correct, and Performant Distributed Systems

**Abstract:** We’ve been stuck with programming models for distributed systems that force developers to individually program a fleet of sequential programs and manually reason about global correctness, or leverage frameworks that lock the developer into global scaling and fault tolerance decisions. Choreographic programming gives us a step in the right direction, by letting developers write distributed programs while avoiding opaque network boundaries. But it has significant limitations when it comes to reasoning about concurrent executions. In this talk, I’ll present the key ideas behind Hydro, a Rust framework for general-purpose distributed systems. I’ll show how Hydro leverages stream-choreographic programming to offer low-level control with strong correctness guarantees.

**Bio:** Shadaj is a final-year PhD student co-advised by Alvin Cheung and Joe Hellerstein in the Sky Computing Lab at UC Berkeley. He designs programming paradigms that make distributed systems modular, correct, accessible, and performant. His research spans foundational language design, program optimization, and formal methods. Shadaj is a co-organizer of the SF Systems Club, the largest systems-oriented meetup in the Bay Area, and loves to play the sitar in his spare time.
