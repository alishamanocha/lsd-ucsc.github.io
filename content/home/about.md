<img src="/img/trip-2023.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left:35px; margin-bottom: 10px; height: auto; width: auto; max-width: 33%; min-width: 200px;" alt="The LSD Lab on our annual LSD Trip, fall 2023" />

The **Languages, Systems, and Data (LSD) Lab** at UC Santa Cruz is a loosely organized federation of [CSE](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) students, researchers, and faculty, working in **programming languages**, **systems**, **databases**, and their intersections.  We aim to cultivate a community where all of these research traditions can intermingle and benefit from one another.
