<strong>Organizers</strong>: Lindsey Kuper, Tyler Sorensen, and Gan Shen <br /></p>

<hr />

<p>The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you&rsquo;re an undergrad and need a permission code).</p>

<p>For winter 2024, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.</p>

<p>Talks will be advertised on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce</a> (for anyone) and <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lsd-group</a> (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Beta Ziliani</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Making monkeys and ducks behave with Crystal Lang</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the zoo of programming languages there are two cute yet rather misbehaved animals, typically found in the Dynamic Languages section: the Duck Typing and the Monkey Patching.</p>

<p>The Duck Typing is hardly seen.  You hear a “quack!“, but you can’t easily tell if it’s coming from an actual duck, a parrot, or a recording.  Monkey Patching, like the name suggests, patches any existing creature to change their behavior.  It can even make a dog quack!</p>

<p>While these two animals bring lots of joy, they are also quite dangerous when used in the wild, as they can bring unexpected behavior to the rest of the creatures.</p>

<p>Crystal is a rarity in the Static Languages section that has Duck Typing and Monkey Patching.  Given the strong &ndash; yet barely visible &ndash; fences of types, it manages to properly contain these beasts.  In this talk I will present Crystal and provide a glimpse at how it manages to feel so dynamic while being safe and efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Beta leads the development of the Crystal Programming Language and teaches about programming languages at Universidad Nacional de Córdoba in Argentina.  With a recent past as a researcher in programming languages, he developed tools and theories for two very different languages: Coq and Lua.  He has no ducks nor monkeys, despite them being effective weapons against Córdoba&rsquo;s venomous scorpions.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Devashish Purandare</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Shimmer: Supercharging Adoption of Modern SSD Interfaces</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While the demand for NAND-flash-based storage keeps growing, capacity increase comes at the cost of degradation in performance and device lifetime. Traditional storage abstractions exacerbate such degradation, increasing garbage collection overhead due to in-place updates. Even flash-optimized append-only systems suffer the overhead of interleaving unrelated data streams. Host-device coordination techniques allow the host to provide the device with hints, which help the SSD to ensure performance isolation across write streams and reduce garbage collection overhead by grouping data related by lifetime. However, such devices have seen limited adoption due to the difficulty of rewriting applications and filesystems and the impact on their stability, security, and portability in the face of changing interfaces.</p>

<p>We present Shimmer, an all-userspace shim layer that enables host-device coordination with no change to the system or the application. Shimmer utilizes application insights to provide intelligent placement hints to any capable storage backend and can shield applications and filesystems from changing interfaces. We demonstrate Shimmer&rsquo;s ease of adoption by enabling host-device coordination for popular IO intensive applications: RocksDB, WiredTiger and Cachelib. Shimmer improves write throughput by 20-90%, depending on the application over modern filesystems like f2fs and can match application-specific backends like ZenFs, offering up to 14× lower tail latency and reduced write amplification.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dev is a PhD candidate researching storage systems, SSDs, and data management at the Center for Research in Storage and Systems, UC Santa Cruz. He works on systems that enable easier host-device coordination for performance and reliability improvements. His latest project, Shimmer, allows easy shim layers to generate and provide lifetime hints that improve the performance of log-structured systems on top of SSDs with no change to applications or operating systems.He will be graduating in March and is actively seeking full time opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Joe Cutler</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> delta: ordered types for stream processing</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present delta, a new language for building stream processing programs. Unlike other streaming languages which restrict the programmer to a small set of combinators, programs in delta are written as standard functional list programs, written as if they transform the entire input at once.  However, delta is equipped with a semantics which runs these list programs as stream programs, producing their outputs incrementally as inputs arrive.  To accomplish this, delta uses a novel “ordered” substructural type system to ensure that all well-typed programs can be executed incrementally. The type system also enforces further guarantees, ensuring that the programs are monotone — they never “retract” a previous output — and that they are deterministic, even in the presence of parallel inputs. In the talk, I’ll discuss the design of the delta type system, how it guarantees the above properties, and how it enables a radical new programming model for stream processing.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Joe Cutler is a 3rd year PhD Student at The University of Pennsylvania, where he works with Benjamin Pierce on all things type systems.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Katherine Philip</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Formalizing Type-Directed Specialization</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a formal study of type-directed specialization, an implementation and optimization technique for implementing parametric polymorphism in programming languages. Type-directed specialization (also known as monomorphization) systematically eliminates polymorphic code by generating monomorphic copies, each specialized for a particular type. We focus on the full specialization of parametric polymorphic expressions in an ML-like language that uses the Hindley-Milner type system. We formalize this with a family of representation transformation functions that translate source language programs into a novel target language that is capable of binding the potentially infinite families of specialized functions generated by full specialization. A key contribution of this paper is to prove that these functions preserve typing for all well-typed source programs. Finally, we lay the groundwork for future study of semantics preservation and for the formalization of other kinds of specialization and representation transformations.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Katherine is a PhD student at Portland State University, advised by Mark P. Jones. They are interested in the design and implementation of efficient languages for low-level systems development. Currently, they are working on the Habit programming language (<a href="https://www.habit-lang.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.habit-lang.org/</a>).</p>
