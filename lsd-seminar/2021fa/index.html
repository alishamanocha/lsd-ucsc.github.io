<p>Welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Cheaper (&amp; correct) blockchain protocols and programs</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We will explore how we can make it cheaper to run blockchain protocols and programs&mdash;while guaranteeing correctness!</p>

<p>For cheaper protocols, we move from a block<em>chain</em> to a block<em>graph</em>. Such a blockgraph, which we show to be a reliable point-to-point link, is built together by a set of servers. Thereby, the servers embed many parallel runs of a deterministic protocol into it. And because the protocol is deterministic, every server can locally replay the protocol&mdash;and no more messages need to be sent [1]!</p>

<p>For cheaper programs, we super-optimize bytecode of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which runs on many servers to execute programs on the blockchain. Now, to avoid the halting problem, every executed bytecode costs money. So we have a clear optimization target&mdash;money&mdash;and we use an automated theorem prover to synthesize cheaper, observationally equivalent, programs [2].</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> <a href="https://maria-a-schett.net/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria A Schett</a> is currently finishing her PhD on &ldquo;Cost Reduction With Guarantees: Formal Reasoning Applied To Blockchain Technologies&rdquo; at University College London. She loves living in London and talking about blockchains, distributed systems, and compilers. She is conversational in term rewriting and qualitative research (from a previous life) and in Esperanto.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Rescuing Data Center Processors</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To serve billions of users around the world, modern web applications that run across data centers access huge datasets and perform complex application logic. As a result, data center applications face two major challenges: (1) poor data access behavior and (2) poor instruction access behavior. In my research, I demonstrate that novel hardware-software codesign effectively solves both challenges. Specifically, I observe that both data and instruction accesses in data center applications follow a deeply repetitive pattern that can be efficiently optimized by profiling the application’s program flow behavior. In this talk, I will first present an overview of my techniques to improve data and instruction accesses. I will then describe two of my techniques in detail, showing how these techniques outperform prior proposals from Google.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Tanvir Ahmed Khan is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. He is interested in designing techniques at the boundary of hardware and software that enable software to better leverage hardware resources. He was a Facebook Fellowship (2020) finalist. His research on data center applications’ performance optimizations has appeared in top computer architecture and systems venues like ISCA, MICRO, PLDI, and OSDI. His work is being used by Intel and ARM to design the next-generation CPU architectures. Tanvir expects to graduate soon and after graduation, he is interested in tenure-track faculty positions.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Data Driven Program Merge</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In collaborative software development, <em>program merging</em> is the mechanism to integrate changes from multiple programmers. The most widespread merge algorithm, employed in modern version control systems, is an <em>unstructured</em> merge. Unstructured merge treats input programs as a sequence of characters and reports a conflict when changes interfere textually. On the other hand, <em>structured</em> approaches leverage knowledge of the underlying language to perform “intelligent” merges over the program’s AST. These approaches have shown significant advancements in automatic merging for Java. However, these methods have not found their way into modern version control systems as they are typically language dependent and do not generalize to dynamic languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>In a 1991 seminal paper on program merge [1], Westfechtel voiced: “A tool is <em>urgently</em> needed which automates the process of merging as much as possible.”  Thirty years later, and there have not been significant advances in the prevailing merge algorithm - unstructured merge.</p>

<p>In this work, we take a <em>fresh data-driven</em> look at the problem of merge resolution. Guided by a multilingual dataset of over 200,000 merges, we explore deep learning techniques to resolve unstructured merge conflicts. Our key innovation is an edit-aware embedding of merge inputs.</p>

<p>Our resulting model achieves 63&ndash;68% accuracy of merge resolution synthesis, yielding nearly a 3x performance improvement over existing structured merge tools. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is sufficiently flexible to work with source code files in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# programming languages, and can generalize zero-shot to unseen languages.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Elizabeth Dinella is a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research interests can be broadly described as “data-driven program reasoning.” Most recently, Elizabeth has worked on data-driven bug finding (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJeqs6EFvB" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hoppity</a>), program merge, and test oracle inference. She is an admirer of coffee and her chow chow puppy Cinnabon.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Better Safe than Sorry: Symbolic Verification for Security Protocols</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A large part of our lives is spent online, creating, sharing, and consuming data in various forms. We use a profusion of security protocols to handle this more-often-than-not sensitive data, and connect to the internet and to the world at large. How secure are these communications? How private? These are fundamental questions to which we demand definitive answers. Even with highly sophisticated methods of testing, one cannot get unconditional answers, and this is where formal verification steps in. One can use logic or automata or similar formal methods to conclusively tell us if there are security flaws in these protocols. In this talk, we will provide a quick and dirty introduction to the world of symbolic verification, with a focus on security protocols. We will then look at a few ways in which the protocols of today’s day and age are modelled and verified.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Vaishnavi Sundararajan is a postdoc at UCSC. She completed her PhD at Chennai Mathematical Institute, with a thesis on formal aspects of certification in security protocols. She is interested in the areas of logic, security, proof theory and verification. Before UCSC, she was a postdoc at IRISA, Rennes, and a Research Associate at Ericsson Research, Bengaluru.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Gradual Verification of Recursive Heap Data Structures</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Current static verification techniques do not provide good support for incrementality, making it difficult for developers to focus on specifying and verifying the properties and components that are most important. Dynamic verification approaches support incrementality, but cannot provide static guarantees. To bridge this gap, prior work proposed gradual verification, which supports incrementality by allowing every assertion to be complete, partial, or omitted, and provides sound verification that smoothly scales from dynamic to static checking. Our OOPSLA’20 paper [1] extended gradual verification to programs that manipulate recursive, mutable data structures on the heap. This talk outlines our extension and discusses technical challenges addressed during its development, such as ensuring consistency between static and dynamic checking. I also present the design of a gradual verifier that we built as follow-up work to our OOPSLA paper. It is implemented on top of the Viper static verifier and supports the C0 programming language. The C0 language is a safer, smaller subset of C taught in introductory CS courses at CMU. Finally, I conclude the talk with my short-term plans to evaluate our tool&mdash;which includes a case study on web browser JIT code&mdash;and my long-term vision for the field of gradual verification.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> I am a fifth year PhD student in the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am co-advised by Jonathan Aldrich and Joshua Sunshine. My research interests lie at the intersection of programming languages, software verification, and software engineering. In general, I intend to make verification technology, like formal verification and program analysis, more usable in practice. Towards this end, my thesis is dedicated to work in gradual verification, which supports incremental formal verification through the use of both static and dynamic techniques. I have also used ideas from gradual verification to produce a gradual null pointer analysis [2] that reduces false positives compared to state-of-the-art tools. It systematically deploys run-time checks wherever the underlying static analysis is imprecise. Further, I previously contributed to the language design of Penrose &mdash; which generates diagrams from mathematical prose &mdash; and Obsidian &mdash; a programming language that facilitates the development of secure blockchain applications. Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, such as League of Legends and Final Fantasy XIV Online. I also enjoy bowling and often average more than 170 points per game!</p>
