<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://research.aldrinmontana.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Aldrin Montana</a></p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Running the Trails of Data Management</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The demise of Moore&rsquo;s law and Dennard scaling have swung a pendulum back towards computational storage&ndash;disk drives equipped with modest processors and working memory. As was the case when the earliest ``active drives&rdquo; were developed over three decades ago, moving computational kernels closer to where the data is stored presents an opportunity to improve data processing and retrieval performance by alleviating bottlenecks at CPUs that can no longer promise exponential increases in performance over time. We explore this opportunity in a 3-way collaboration between industry and academia with the goal of showing the benefits provided by computational storage devices for scientific analysis workloads. The analysis workloads are based on use cases for the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and the UCSC Genomics Institute, the computational storage devices are architected and designed by Seagate, and the system that brings these together is architected by our declarative programmable storage research group at UCSC. This talk uses trail running as a fun metaphor to detail the context and directions of our collaboration that spans data management, single-cell RNA sequencing, and a storage system that leverages computational storage devices.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Aldrin is a 3rd year PhD student at UC Santa Cruz advised by Peter Alvaro, but works extensively with Carlos Maltzahn (UCSC), Jeff LeFevre (UCSC), and Philip Kufeldt (Seagate). Aldrin received his B.S. and M.S. in computer science from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo working with Alex Dekhtyar on a collaborative, microbial source tracking project with professors and students in the biology and biochemistry departments. Before joining UCSC’s PhD program, Aldrin has worked on data management of genomic variants at a biotech company, Personalis, Inc. His research interests are primarily in data management systems and bioinformatics, but also span programming languages, storage systems, and software engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://www.rntz.net/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Arntzenius</a></p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> PL design and programming by voice</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many programmers and other computer users suffer from repetitive strain injuries (RSI) of the hand that make using a keyboard for extended periods painful. For some kinds of RSI, therapy or surgery may resolve the problem, but in recalcitrant cases sometimes the only option is to reduce or cease typing. So what does a programmer do if they can&rsquo;t type?One option is to use your voice. Speech recognition technology has advanced by leaps and bounds over the past decade, but most people&rsquo;s ideas about voice-driven UI are based on convenient but limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, or at best dictation or prose-writing tools. What does a voice interface for expert users look like? A small but growing community of programmers, many affected by RSI, have been developing and using tools that explore this question.I suffer from RSI and use a voice control tool called Talon to program, control my computer, and write my thesis; but I&rsquo;m also a programming languages researcher, and so I find it natural to wonder: how might PL research intersect with voice control? In this talk, I&rsquo;ll try my best to answer that question, as well as a few others:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is voice coding like?  What unique challenges does it present compared with keyboard coding?</li>
<li>What can we learn from this about designing voice interfaces for expert users?  Specifically, how can programming languages better support voice coding?</li>
<li>How does a voice control system work?  What does it have in common with PL implementation?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Depending on how you count, Michael Arntzenius is somewhere between a 4th- and a 9th-year PhD student. He works with Neel Krishnaswami on Datafun, an attempt to combine the bottom-up deductive query language Datalog with higher-order typed functional programming. He is interested in monotonicity as a unifying and simplifying theme in incremental, concurrent, and distributed computation; and generally in the theory, design, and implementation of programming systems.</p>
