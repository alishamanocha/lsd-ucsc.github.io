<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://arquinn.github.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrew Quinn</a></p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Debugging the OmniTable way</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Debugging is time-consuming, accounting for roughly 50% of a developer&rsquo;s time. To identify the cause of a failure, a developer usually tracks the state of their program as it executes on a failing input. Unfortunately, most debugging tools make it difficult for a developer to specify the program state that they wish to observe and computationally expensive to observe execution state. Moreover, existing work to improve our debugging tools often restrict the state that a developer can track by either exposing incomplete execution state or requiring manual instrumentation.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will describe our new debugging approach based on the OmniTable abstraction, which captures all state reached during an execution as a large queryable data table. Our query model built around the OmniTable abstraction supports SQL to simplify debugging without restricting the state that a developer can observe: I’ll show that OmniTable debugging queries are more succinct than equivalent logic specified using existing tools.</p>

<p>Then, I’ll describe how our prototype, SteamDrill, accelerates debugging by taking advantage of how an OmniTable decouples debugging logic from the original execution. Namely, the system employs lazy materialization: it uses deterministic record/replay to store the execution associated with each OmniTable and resolves queries by inspecting replay executions. It employs a novel multi-replay strategy that partitions query resolution across multiple replays and a parallel resolution strategy that simultaneously observes state at multiple points-in-time. I’ll show that SteamDrill queries are an order-of-magnitude faster than existing debugging tools.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Stream Processing Systems for Emerging Trends</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stream processing is proposed and popularized as a “technology like Hadoop but can give you results faster”, which lets users query a continuous data stream and quickly get results within a very short time period from the time of receiving the data. For that reason, stream processing technology has become a critical building block of many applications, such as making business decisions from marketing streams, identifying spam campaigns from social network streams, predicting tornados and storms from radar streams, and analyzing genomes in different labs and countries to track the sources of a potential epidemic. However, state-of-art solutions have dominantly centered around stateless stream processing, leaving another urgent trend—stateful stream processing—much less explored. A driving need is that the future stream applications need to store and update state along with their processing, and process live data streams in a timely fashion from massive and geo-distributed data sets. In this talk, I will present a next-generation geo-distributed scalable stateful stream processing system. (1) At the architecture layer, I will introduce a decentralized “many masters/many workers” architecture that improves the scalability of stream processing systems. (2) At the mechanism layer, I will present a fragment-based parallel recovery mechanism that recovers large distributed states by leveraging erasure codes. Finally, I will outline the emerging trends for developing stream processing systems.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Modeling and Testing for MicroBus</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MicroBus is a newly developed replication service at AWS that provides consistency, durability, and fault tolerance guarantees. Both modeling and testing have been employed to ensure its correctness and have shown some success. Nevertheless, they all have shortcomings, with modeling not connected with the implementation and testing only covering limited scenarios. To solve this, we propose model-based testing as a hybrid approach that combines the best of the two worlds.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will first give a gentle introduction to the MicroBus protocol/implementation and the pros and cons of modeling and testing. Then I will explain the model-based testing approach and the benefits it brings on to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Powering data centers the smart way</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Infrastructure powering current workloads is very
  heterogeneous: central data centers with various hardware
  accelerators, edge data centers with constraint resources and a
  variety of client devices with different capabilities. Orchestrating
  all these players can be a challenge and this talk will touch on how
  ML (or DL) can actually help. First, we will deep-dive into two
  projects: we will explore the use of Reinforcement learning for
  optimal container placement in edge data centers, and also visit an
  unsupervised approach for anomaly detection in containers, in
  particular, the noisy neighbor effect. After that, we will briefly
  learn about some on-going projects around autoscaling for ML
  pipelines, performance degradation detection in serverless
  functions, bottleneck detection with GANs and high-level
  sustainability scores for latency sensitive/critical tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr. Tania Lorido-Botran is a Research Scientist at
  Roblox. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft and the Pacific
  Northwest National Laboratory. During her PhD, she had the
  opportunity to spend one year at Rice University and also did two
  internships at VMware and HP Labs. Dr. Lorido Botran received her
  PhD from the University of Deusto in Spain with a Cum Laude
  distinction, and her master’s degree in Distributed systems from
  University of the Basque Country with a highest marks
  distinction. Her current research interests span across ML for
  systems, data center sustainability and fault-tolerance.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Applying consensus and replication securely with FLAQR</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Availability is crucial to the security of distributed systems, but guaranteeing availability is hard, especially when
participants in the system may act maliciously. Quorum replication protocols provide both integrity and availability: data and computation
is replicated at multiple independent hosts, and a quorum of these hosts must agree on the output of all operations applied to the data.
Unfortunately, these protocols have high overhead and can be difficult to calibrate for a specific application’s needs. Ideally, developers could
use highlevel abstractions for consensus and replication to write fault tolerant code that is secure by construction. This paper presents
Flow-Limited Authorization for Quorum Replication (FLAQR), a core calculus for building distributed applications with heterogeneous
quorum replication protocols while enforcing end-to-end information security. Our type system ensures that well-typed FLAQR programs cannot
fail (experience an unrecoverable error) in ways that violate their typelevel specifications. We present noninterference theorems that characterize
FLAQR’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the presence of consensus, replication, and failures, as well as a liveness theorem for the class of majority quorum protocols under a bounded number of faults.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Priyanka Mondal is a PhD student at the University of California Santa Cruz, where she is supervised by Professor Owen Arden and Professor Ioannis Demertzis. Her research areas include Applied Cryptography, Programming Languages and Security in Distributed Systems. Prior to joining UCSC she worked as a software engineer at Citrix R&amp;D Bangalore.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~yahuis/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Yahui Song</a></p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Automated Temporal Verification with Extended Regular Expressions</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Existing approaches to temporal verification have either sacrificed modularity in favor of achieving automation or vice-versa. To exploit the best of both worlds, we present a new framework to ensure temporal properties via Hoare-style verifiers and term rewriting systems (TRSs).</p>

<p>The leading technique of temporal verification is automata-based model checking, which has possible insufficiencies: (i) it requires a manual modeling stage and needs to be bounded when encountering non-terminating traces; (ii) to conveniently deploy existing inclusion-checkers for automata, the expressiveness power is limited by the finite-state automata; and (iii) there is always a gap between the verified logic and the actual implementation from the program.</p>

<p>To tackle these issues, we propose a framework that conducts local temporal verification, which leads to a modular and compositional verification strategy, where temporal reasoning can be combined to reason about the overall program. Meanwhile, we propose various effect logics to be the temporal specification languages, which are essentially extended regular expressions (REs), pushing the expressiveness boundary of the most deployed linear temporal logic (LTL). Furthermore, the proposed framework devises purely algebraic TRS to check the inclusions for the novel logics, avoiding the complex translation into automata.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and various REs-based temporal logics in different domains; presents the corresponding prototype systems, case studies, experimental results, and necessary proofs.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Yahui Song is a 5th year PhD Student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Associate Professor Chin Wei Ngan. Her interests are automated program verification and programming language design. Her current works are dedicated to more expressive and efficient temporal verification.</p>
